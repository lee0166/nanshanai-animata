## 📖 Introduction

**Kmeng AI Animata** is an open-source AI video creation tool designed to transform your local computer into a professional digital studio.

Built with a **Local-First** architecture, it leverages the File System Access API to read and write directly to your local drive, eliminating the need for cloud uploads and ensuring maximum data privacy. Deeply integrated with state-of-the-art models like **Volcengine (Doubao)** and **Vidu**, it provides a streamlined workflow from character design and scene building to final video generation.
